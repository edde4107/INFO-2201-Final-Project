# INFO-2201-Final-Project
Programming for Information Science 2 Final project

Your project will be oriented around a question that you pose in your project proposal and then answer in your project submission and presentation. The question you pose should be one that requires both data and code to answer. Thus, the answer to the question should be "non-obvious" to the average person. Your project must also be fully of your own design, and it must not be a project that you created for a different class, including a previous INFO 2201 class.

In order to meet the requirements for this project, you will need to use at least three different data sources, and those data sources must be a mix of at least two different structural types. Furthermore, the answer to your question must require integrating those data sources in some way; it can't just be based on three separate analyses of your data sources. You are allowed to use data sources that we used in class or were suggested for your at-home practice, but those data sources will not count toward this requirement of having at least three data sources and at least two different structural types.

The question I am aiming to answer is this, "Do historically redlined neighborhoods in Denver still show economic disparities in income, racial composition, or home value today?"
